  // 1. Get the user's email address.
  var userEmail = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();

  // 2. Get a motivational quote.  You can use a few different methods:

  // a) Array of Quotes (Simplest - good for a small set of quotes):
  var quotes = [
    "The only way to do great work is to love what you do. - Steve Jobs",
    "Believe you can and you're halfway there. - Theodore Roosevelt",
    "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. - Eleanor Roosevelt",
    "Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going. - Sam Levenson",
    "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today. - Franklin D. Roosevelt",
    // Add more quotes here...
    "It always seems impossible until it's done. - Nelson Mandela",
    "Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value. - Albert Einstein",
    "The best way to predict the future is to create it. - Peter Drucker",
    "Happiness is not something readymade. It comes from your own actions. - Dalai Lama",
    "Whatever you are, be a good one. - Abraham Lincoln"
  ];
  var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length);
  var quote = quotes[randomIndex];

  // b) Using a Quote API (More Dynamic - requires internet access):
  /*
  // Example using a free quote API (replace with your preferred API):
  var apiUrl = "https://api.quotable.io/random"; // Example API - test it!
  try {
    var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(apiUrl);
    var data = JSON.parse(response.getContentText());
    var quote = data.content + " - " + data.author;
  } catch (error) {
    Logger.log("Error fetching quote from API: " + error);
    quote = "Quote could not be retrieved.  Check the API."; // Fallback message
  }
  */

  // 3. Send the email.
  var subject = "Daily Motivational Quote";
  var body = "Here is your daily dose of motivation:\n\n" + quote;

  MailApp.sendEmail({
    to: userEmail,
    subject: subject,
    body: body
